## Getting Started

1. Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) if not already installed, and be sure to include the dependencies for .NET and desktop development.
    - _Note: You need to use Visual Studio (not Visual Studio Code). Visual Studio Code does not have winforms designers._
2. [Download](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/dotnet-winforms-examples/archive/main.zip) this repository and unzip the contents.
3. Open the `dotnet-winforms-examples.sln` file in Visual Studio.
